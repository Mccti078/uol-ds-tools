# Data Science Tools
This is a dump of all the tools I've recommended throughout the course. Let me know if I've forgotten anything and I'll add it somewhere. Or even better, update the document and submit a pull request :sparkles:

## Development Environment
### [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)
Linux command line for Windows 10.

Now you can ssh, cp, vim, and rm -rf your Windows files!

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Lightweight and full featured development environment that integrates with WSL.

If you're new to IDEs, [try the tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics).

VSCode has thousands of extensions for all types of programming languages - all you need to get started is [Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

If you're using WSL you'll want to [try the WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial), too.

### [Microsoft Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
Terminal manager
* Tabs
* Panes
* [Customisation](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/06/30/3-ways-to-customize-your-windows-terminal/)

### [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
Git GUI for managing your repos, merges, branches etc.

## Productivity and Organisation

### [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/)
Free mindmapping software.

### [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
Academic referencing and bibliography management.

## Quick Reference

### [Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/)
Quick reference for useful Linux shell commands.

### [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=rsync+-avhP+file1+file2)
Look up any combination of shell commands and flags.

### Cheat.sh
The standard documentation for most shell commands is terse and unhelpful. Try this for example
```bash
man ls
```
A simpler tldr version can be called like this
```bash
curl cheat.sh/<command>
```
Execute this on the command line
```bash
curl cheat.sh/rsync
```
Or, if you want search and scrolling
```bash
curl cheat.sh/rsync | less
```
